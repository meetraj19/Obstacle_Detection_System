Obstacle Detection System


a) An advanced obstacle detection system was developed using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models to enhance railway
safety by identifying a wide range of objects and potential hazards in the railway environment. The dataset for this project
was meticulously compiled from various sources, including Roboﬂow, Kaggle, and other internet repositories, resulting in a
collection of approximately 15,000 images.

b) The dataset was preprocessed and converted into the Roboﬂow format to streamline the training process. The YOLO models
were then trained to detect and classify 29 distinct classes of objects relevant to railway operations, which include:
Signals: Green, Yellow, and Red signals, crucial for controlling train movements.
Station Lights: Differentiating between Station Lights Off and On.
Common Obstacles: Objects like bicycles, cars, trees, and buildings that could obstruct the track.
Railway-Speciﬁc Objects: Dwarf signals, railway tracks, rusted tracks, and other infrastructure elements speciﬁc to the
railway environment.
Safety Hazards: Fire, smoke, plastic bags, and other potential threats that could compromise train safety.
Miscellaneous: Fencing, pillars, instruction signs, surveillance equipment, and more

c) The system's ability to recognize a wide range of objects and scenarios contributes signiﬁcantly to enhancing the safety,
reliability, and efﬁciency of railway networks. It minimizes human error in monitoring the tracks, ensuring that potential
threats are identiﬁed and addressed promptly.
